# FAQ
 - **Can I Get Banned?** *No, this program does not directly interact with Fortnite's game files, memory, or any other processes. The only usage of Fortnite is to draw the GDI+ StormTracker Lines, but even that is only used as a dummy window. Note that we are still not sure how Epic will react to this.*
